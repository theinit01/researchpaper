\section{Introduction}

The advancement of digital education platforms has significantly transformed the way laboratory-based assessments are conducted. In academic settings—particularly in computer science and engineering—coding laboratories are essential for evaluating students’ problem-solving skills and programming proficiency. However, conducting such assessments in remote or semi-remote environments introduces major challenges in terms of security, scalability, interactivity, and real-time feedback.

Traditional learning management systems (LMS) and standalone remote proctoring tools often fall short of providing a unified environment where students can write, execute, and debug code with integrated instructor monitoring and automated evaluation. These platforms typically lack sandboxed execution, dynamic AI assistance, and network-layer traffic control mechanisms necessary for secure and fair assessment.

To bridge these gaps, we propose a \textit{Secure Web-Based Lab Examination System}, which offers a robust, scalable, and real-time solution for conducting programming evaluations. The platform features a React.js-based frontend, a Flask (or optionally Go-based) backend, and utilizes Docker containers for isolated and secure code execution. To enforce academic integrity, the system integrates NGINX reverse proxies along with Pi-hole DNS filtering and WireGuard VPN tunneling to monitor and restrict network traffic during assessments.

Furthermore, a locally hosted AI assistant, powered by LLaMA 3.2, is embedded to assist students during lab sessions with syntax debugging, error correction, and code optimization—while being automatically disabled during formal exams to prevent unauthorized help. This hybrid integration of secure infrastructure, AI support, and network control enables a next-generation solution for digital laboratory environments.

A key innovation of the system is the 
combination of automated assessment, AI
assisted coding, and real-time instructor 
monitoring. This allows for a robust and 
scalable environment suitable for universities 
and institutions seeking to modernize their 
evaluation mechanisms without compromising 
security or interactivity. This paper presents the 
system architecture, implementation details, 
performance modelling, and an analysis of how 
such a platform can enhance the quality and 
reliability of remote laboratory assessments.  


\section{Literature Review}

The increasing demand for secure and scalable online programming environments has spurred substantial research into web-based IDEs and remote code execution platforms. Early systems such as CodeRunner and Coding Rooms introduced cloud-based solutions where students could write and run code online. However, these platforms often lacked critical features such as containerized execution and real-time security monitoring.

Several studies have explored the design and educational impact of browser-based compilers and IDEs. Gupta et al. emphasized the use of lightweight frontend frameworks like React.js to enhance user interactivity. While effective for general use, such systems typically fall short in examination settings due to insufficient isolation and monitoring. Platforms like CodeOcean addressed execution isolation using Docker containers but did not incorporate real-time proctoring or AI-driven support.

The rise of large language models (LLMs) such as GitHub Copilot and OpenAI Codex has opened new avenues for AI-assisted programming. Research by Ahmad et al. demonstrates that such tools can reduce student frustration and improve learning outcomes when ethically deployed. However, commercial tools raise concerns about data privacy and external codebase exposure during exams. In contrast, our system incorporates a locally hosted LLM (LLaMA 3.2) to offer secure and context-aware assistance suitable for examination environments.

Ensuring academic integrity in remote exams remains a significant challenge. Traditional proctoring approaches—such as webcam monitoring or browser lockdown—are often invasive and circumventable. Mehta et al. proposed using NGINX-based reverse proxy and network monitoring to restrict web access. Our platform builds on this by integrating network-level filtering and activity logging directly into the examination interface.

Automated grading systems like PyTest, JUnit, and UnitTest have been widely adopted in MOOCs and online coding platforms. These ensure consistent evaluation of code submissions. Our system extends this by combining real-time scoring with detailed logs of code execution and AI interactions, enabling instructors to audit both correctness and behavior.

Instructor dashboards are vital for real-time visibility into student progress. While platforms such as Repl.it Classroom and Gradescope offer basic code correctness tracking, they often lack insights into user behavior and network activity. In contrast, our system’s live dashboard aggregates submissions, AI usage logs, and internet access patterns, enabling rapid instructor intervention when necessary.


\section{Proposed System}

\subsection{System Architecture}

The proposed system is designed to ensure scalability, responsiveness, and security for conducting online programming assessments. It integrates a modern frontend interface, a scalable backend, containerized code execution, and a secure network monitoring layer. These components work together to deliver an interactive and controlled examination environment suited for educational institutions.

\subsubsection{Front-End: React.js with Monaco Editor}

The frontend is developed using React.js, a widely adopted JavaScript library that supports dynamic, component-based user interfaces. This allows students to experience seamless, real-time interactions as they write and execute code directly in the browser. To enhance usability, the Monaco Editor—based on Visual Studio Code—is embedded in the platform. It provides essential features such as syntax highlighting, error detection, auto-completion, and layout customization, offering a familiar development experience.

\subsubsection{Back-End: Flask and Go}

The backend is implemented using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, with optional support for Go for handling performance-intensive tasks. It manages user authentication, session lifecycles, and container orchestration for code execution. The backend also controls AI-assisted code guidance, ensuring students receive contextual help without accessing external resources. Furthermore, it incorporates real-time logging to track user interactions and support administrative oversight.

\subsubsection{Real-Time Communication: Socket.IO}

To support real-time interactions, Socket.IO is employed for bidirectional communication between the frontend and backend. This enables immediate feedback on code execution, AI assistant responses, and dynamic updates during assessments. By minimizing communication latency, Socket.IO ensures a responsive and interactive user experience critical to live coding environments.

\subsection{Code Execution Environment}

Each student’s session is isolated within a dedicated Docker container, ensuring sandboxed execution and security. A queuing model is used to manage simultaneous requests for code execution and AI assistance.

\subsubsection{M/M/1 Queuing Model}

The code execution environment can be modeled using an M/M/1 queuing system. This reflects scenarios where students concurrently interact with the AI assistant, submit code, and are monitored in real time. The system maintains a single service queue, handling incoming requests and dispatching them to available containers based on session order and resource availability.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Notations Table }
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|p{5.5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Meaning} \\
\hline
$\lambda$ & Arrival rate of student code submissions per unit time \\
\hline
$\mu$ & Service rate of code execution (container runtime per request) \\
\hline
$\gamma$ & AI response rate (suggestion latency per request) \\
\hline
$\theta$ & Monitoring frequency (network checks per second) \\
\hline
$n$ & Number of concurrent students \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table:mm1-notation}
\end{table}

\subsection{Queuing Model and Performance Metrics}

We model the code execution service as an M/M/1 queuing system, where:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
    \item \textbf{Arrival process:} Poisson with arrival rate $\lambda$
    \item \textbf{Service time:} Exponentially distributed with mean $\frac{1}{\mu}$
\end{itemize}

The key performance metrics for the system are:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
    \item \textbf{Server Utilization:}
    \[
        \rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}, \quad \text{for } \rho < 1
    \]

    \item \textbf{Expected number of requests in the system (L):}
    \[
        L = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho}
    \]

    \item \textbf{Average response time (W):}
    \[
        W = \frac{1}{\mu - \lambda}
    \]
\end{itemize}
This model helps estimate the required number of Docker containers based on student load. 

\subsubsection{Containerization with Docker}

To ensure secure and isolated code execution, each student session is encapsulated within a dedicated Docker container. This setup guarantees that code runs in a sandboxed environment, fully isolated from the host system and other users. Each container is preconfigured with the necessary compilers, interpreters, and evaluation tools needed for the assignment, maintaining consistency and reducing setup variability.

Containerization also supports horizontal scalability, enabling the system to handle multiple concurrent users by dynamically deploying new containers without resource conflicts or performance degradation.

\subsubsection{Automated Code Evaluation}

To automate and streamline the assessment workflow, the system uses Python’s \texttt{PyTest} or \texttt{UnitTest} frameworks depending on the course requirements and programming language used. Each student submission is evaluated against a set of predefined test cases, and the output is verified for correctness. Scores are generated automatically, ensuring immediate feedback for students and efficient grading for instructors. This method enforces fairness and standardization across evaluations.

\subsection{AI-Powered Code Assistance}

A core innovation of the platform is the integration of a locally hosted AI assistant powered by LLaMA 3.2, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM). The assistant provides real-time support during coding sessions by suggesting syntax corrections, completing partial code snippets, and offering contextual guidance for code refactoring.

Unlike commercial AI tools that risk providing direct answers, this assistant is tuned to promote conceptual understanding and debugging skills. It supports students through guided suggestions while maintaining academic integrity, especially by being disabled during examination sessions.

\subsubsection{Response Model: M/M/m Queue}

Let $\gamma$ represent the response rate of a single AI thread, and $q$ be the number of concurrent AI requests. Assuming the AI module runs with $m$ parallel processing threads, we model the AI assistant's responsiveness using an M/M/m queuing system.

\noindent
\textbf{Expected AI Response Time:}
\begin{equation}
    W_{\text{AI}} = \frac{L_q}{\lambda} + \frac{1}{\gamma}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $L_q$ is the average number of requests in the AI queue, which can be estimated using the Erlang-C formula.

\subsection{Security and Monitoring}

\subsubsection{Reverse Proxy with NGINX}

To enforce strict security protocols during examinations, the system employs NGINX as a reverse proxy server. It serves as the entry point for HTTP requests, routing them to backend services while simultaneously acting as a filter. During exams, NGINX restricts student access to a predefined list of allowed domains, thereby preventing access to unauthorized websites and external online resources. This layer of control is critical for maintaining a secure, isolated, and academically honest testing environment.

\subsubsection{Real-Time Activity Logging}

The platform captures and stores detailed logs of student activity for both live and retrospective analysis. Tracked events include code execution timestamps, AI assistant queries, and network behaviors observed through proxy and DNS logs. These records are securely stored in MongoDB, enabling instructors to verify student engagement, detect anomalies, and assess exam integrity. Such logs are also essential for audit trails, behavioral analytics, and identifying potential academic misconduct.

\subsubsection{Graph Model for Network Monitoring}

We define a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, where:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
    \item $V$: Set of nodes representing entities in the system (e.g., students, NGINX proxy, Docker containers, LLM assistant, and the instructor dashboard)
    \item $E$: Set of directed edges representing secure HTTP/HTTPS communication flows between entities
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Security Rule Compliance per Edge } $e \in E$:
\begin{equation}
S(e) =
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if traffic conforms to allowed patterns} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Total Compliance Score}:
\begin{equation}
S_{\text{total}} = \sum_{e \in E} S(e)
\end{equation}

Traffic violating the security policy is blocked (i.e., edges with $S(e) = 0$ are considered non-compliant and denied at the proxy level).

\textbf{Anomaly Detection (Bayesian Inference)}:
\begin{equation}
P_{\text{anomaly}} = P(A_i \mid B_i)
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
    \item $A_i$: Suspicious activity (e.g., repeated failed submissions)
    \item $B_i$: Observed browsing behavior or network access logs
\end{itemize}

This model enables real-time detection of abnormal behavior and can be used to generate alerts during assessments.


\subsection{Instructor Dashboard}

The platform includes a comprehensive administrative dashboard that enables instructors to monitor and assess student performance during lab sessions and examinations. This panel provides a live feed of code submissions, AI assistant usage, and real-time network behavior. Instructors can identify students who are either struggling or potentially violating academic policies based on behavioral patterns. The dashboard also features automated grading based on test case outcomes, with the option for manual overrides to allow human judgment. This dual-layer evaluation approach ensures accurate and holistic assessment.

\subsubsection{Instructor Monitoring Load (Resource Utilization)}

To maintain system responsiveness and avoid data loss, the system logs the following activity rates:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
    \item $\lambda_c$: Rate of code submissions
    \item $\lambda_a$: Rate of AI interactions
    \item $\lambda_n$: Rate of network events
\end{itemize}

The total logging throughput is given by:
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\text{total}} = \lambda_c + \lambda_a + \lambda_n
\end{equation}

Let $\mu_{db}$ denote the MongoDB write throughput capacity. To prevent logging backlog or data loss, the system enforces the condition:
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\text{total}} < \mu_{db}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Workflow Summary}

The system workflow is designed to support the entire lab assessment lifecycle, from authentication to evaluation. Students begin by logging into the secure web portal. They write code using the Monaco Editor embedded within the React.js interface. During lab sessions, the AI assistant offers real-time guidance through contextual suggestions and syntax corrections.

Upon execution, the student's code runs inside a dedicated Docker container equipped with the required compilers and testing frameworks. The results are evaluated against predefined test cases using \texttt{PyTest} or \texttt{UnitTest}~\cite{ref19,ref20}. Concurrently, NGINX monitors browsing activity to ensure compliance with security policies, and all interactions are logged into MongoDB.

Instructors access the dashboard to monitor submissions, AI usage, and network events. They can also review analytics, adjust grades, or intervene in real time. This structured workflow ensures a secure, seamless, and supportive experience for both students and educators.

\subsubsection{Evaluation and Scoring Model}

Each student’s code submission is evaluated against a set of $k$ predefined test cases:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
    \item $T = \{t_1, t_2, \dots, t_k\}$: Set of test cases
    \item $R = \{r_1, r_2, \dots, r_k\}$: Binary result vector (1 = pass, 0 = fail)
    \item $w_i$: Weight assigned to each test case such that $\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i = 1$
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Final Score Calculation:}
\begin{equation}
S = \sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i \cdot r_i
\end{equation}

\noindent
\textbf{Total Evaluation Time:}
\begin{equation}
T_{\text{eval}} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} T_i
\end{equation}

\noindent
Where $T_i$ is the execution time of test case $t_i$.

\section{Results}

\section{Conclusion}

The integration of containerized code execution, AI-assisted learning, and real-time network monitoring into a unified platform remains largely underexplored in academic environments. This work addresses that gap by introducing a secure, scalable, and intelligent system for conducting programming laboratory examinations online.

This paper presented the design and implementation of a real-time, web-based code execution and monitoring platform tailored for educational assessments. The system integrates modern frontend and backend frameworks, containerization via Docker, AI-based code guidance through a locally hosted LLM (LLaMA 3.2), and security enforcement using NGINX and DNS filtering. Together, these components deliver a controlled, efficient, and integrity-focused environment for programming evaluations.

The results validate the effectiveness of the system under concurrent user load, demonstrating low response times, AI latency under 3 seconds, stable logging throughput, and high compliance in network monitoring. Instructors benefit from enhanced visibility and analytics, while students gain access to intelligent support without compromising examination rules.

Future enhancements may include the addition of more programming language environments, AI response tuning based on student proficiency, offline sync capabilities, and seamless integration with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS).
